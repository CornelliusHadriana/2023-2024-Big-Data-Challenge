# 2023-2024-Big-Data-Challenge

Our research provides datasets on different national parks and the different species that were seen there before. The names of the national park, as well as the scientific and common name of
each species studied, are provided at the top of each dataset. The datasets give better
understanding on how we can sustain the biodiversity of specific areas. While creating our method of collecting data, we encountered problems involving data being taken by unauthorized users for unethical actions. Our solution to that involves using geospatial masking and AI-assisted anonymization to ensure that the sensitive information of species occurrences are not shared. Data security, legal and ethical concerns, and possible threats to the regionsâ€™ biodiversity
are the main factors we focused on while deciding with our method of creating the research paper and solutions to sustaining biodiversity.
